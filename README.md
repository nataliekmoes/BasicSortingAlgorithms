Implementations of the sorting algorithms **Merge Sort** and **Quicksort**.

The implementation of **Merge Sort** is defined in the file `Mergesort.cpp`. The implementation of **Quicksort** can be found in the file `QuickSort.c`.
Each algorithm can be demonstrated by executing the example defined in the `main` function.
